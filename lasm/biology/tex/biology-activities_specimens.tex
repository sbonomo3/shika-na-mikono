\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Prepare cages and traps from the plastic water bottles. Purchase rat traps from the market.}
\item{Collect living and non-living things by using the traps and cages.}
\item{Put the collected organisms in cages, petri dishes, and plastic cups for student observation.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Observe the specimens, drawing and labeling each.}
\item{Record the characteristics of life you observe in each specimen.}
\item{Categorize the specimens as living or non-living using your observations.}
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{How can you determine if a specimen is a living organism?}

\section{Introduction to Classification}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Students will be able to group living things according to their similarities and differences.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
Because there are so many different living things in the world, biologists put these organisms into groups to make it easier to study and identify them. This process is called classification. Classification enables scientists to make predictions. When we know the characteristics of a group we can predict the features of an organism in that group. For example, an owl and chicken are both birds. If we know what the heart of a chicken looks like we can predict what the heart of an owl will look like even if we have not seen it.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Marker pen, cardboard, bread, and a tomato

\subsubsection*{Specimens}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Rat, ants, flower, beetle, fish, worm}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect different living things like fungi, plants of different shapes and sizes, and animals.}
\item{ Place a piece of moist bread near a window to culture bread mould.}
\item{ Cut a tomato in half and leave it overnight to prepare mucour.}
\item{Mount the different specimens on a piece of cardboard box and label each specimens with a single letter.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Display the specimens for observation.}
\item{Group the organisms based on their similarities and differences.}
\item{Classify the organisms, naming their Kingdom, Phylum/Division, and Class. Refer to the previous chapter as a guide.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
Students are expected to observe and group living things according to their similarities and differences.

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all the used materials, storing items that will be used later. No special waste disposal is required.}

\section{Investigation of Division Angiospermophyta}

\subsection{Identification of the Reproductive Parts of the Flowers}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Students will be able to identify the reproductive parts of the flowers.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
Angiosperms develop specialized structures called flowers used for reproduction. A flower is a modified part of a stem in which the primary sex organs are found. A flower has the following parts; peduncle, receptacle, calyx (sepal), corolla (petals), the male reproductive organ called the stamen which consists of filament and anthers which form pollen grains, the female reproductive organs consisting of an ovary, style and stigma. Hibiscus flowers are bisexual because they have both male and female organs in one flower. Some pawpaw flowers have either female or male flowers and are referred to as unisexual flowers. Plants with both male and female flowers on the same plant are called monoecious like maize. Plants with male and female flowers on separate plants are dioecious like a pawpaw plant.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
A variety of flowers like hibiscus, rose, or morning glory, razor blade, hand lens, cardboard box, and a labeled diagram of a flower
