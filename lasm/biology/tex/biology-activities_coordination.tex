\subsection{Using Sense Organs to Make Observations}
\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To use their sense organs to make observations.}
\end{itemize}


There are five sense organs in the human body that we use to make observations. We use our tongue to taste, our nose to smell, our skin to feel, our ears to hear, and our eyes to see.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
A sharp stick, a colourful flower like hibiscus or bougainvillea, salt, sugar, orange or lemon leaves, and 2 pieces of metal

\subsubsection*{Hazards and Safety}
\begin{itemize}
\item{This activity should not be conducted in a laboratory as nothing should ever enter the mouth in a school laboratory.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect from the environment the items mentioned in the materials list.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Provide each group with a sharp stick, flower, small amount of sugar and salt, and a lemon or orange leaf.}
\item{Instruct all students to wash their hands with soap.}
\item{Instruct one partner to close their eyes and open their mouth.}
\item{Instruct the other partner to put a very small amount of sugar and then salt on their partner's tongue. Tell the student to describe the taste of each unknown substance.}
\item{Instruct the student to keep their eyes closed and smell one of the crushed lemon/orange leaves. Guide students to describe the smell of each unknown substance.}
\item{Instruct students to touch each other with a sharp stick and describe the feeling.}
\item{Instruct students to describe the colour and shape of the flower.}
\item{Instruct all students to close their eyes. Strike the metal rods together.}
\item{Guide students to describe what they have heard.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}


\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later. No special waste disposal is required.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Mention the five sense organs and their functions.}
\item{Is there any relationship between the sense of smell and that of taste? Give an explanation.}
\end{enumerate}
