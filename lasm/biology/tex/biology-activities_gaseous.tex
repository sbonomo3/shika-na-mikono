\section{Gaseous Exchange and Respiration}

\subsection{Identification of Carbon Dioxide in Exhaled Air}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Students will be able to identify the presence of carbon dioxide in exhaled air.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
During respiration CO2 gas is produces by the oxidation of food materials in living cells. The gas is a waste product and thus must be removed from the body. It is carried by the blood to the lungs where is it released in exhaled air.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Clear plastic container, plastic straw, lime water, and water

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Prepare a solution of lime water by dissolving 2 spoonfuls of calcium hydroxide into 500 mL of water and letting it sit over night. Decant the solution to prepare a clear solution of lime water.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Put approximately 10 mL of lime water into a clear container.}
\item{Blow exhaled air through the straw and into the limewater until a change is noted.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
Limewater turns milky upon the addition of carbon dioxide. This shows that carbon dioxide is present in exhaled air.

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Unused lime water should be stored in an airtight labeled bottle for future use.}
\item{Used lime water requires no special waste disposal. Do not dump any solid down the drain.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{What change did you observe in the lime water at the end of the experiment?}
\item{What caused the change in limewater?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
Lime water reacts with carbon dioxide to form white calcium carbonate precipitate.
CO2(g)+Ca(OH)2(aq)-->CaCO3(s)+H2O(l)


\subsection{Anaerobic Respiration}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Students will be able to identify the products of anaerobic respiration.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
Respiration is a production of energy through the breakdown of complex organic structures. Anaerobic respiration occurs without oxygen. The products of anaerobic respiration are alcohol and carbon dioxide.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Plastic bottle with lid, syringe*, delivery tube*, cotton wool, test tube*, beaker*, yeast, glucose*, water, and lime water*

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Make a hole on one side of plastic water bottle and connect the delivery tube, making sure there is an airtight seal.}
\item{Boil some water to remove dissolved oxygen and let it cool.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{In the plastic bottle mix 1/2 spoon of glucose , 1/4 spoon of yeast, and approximately 50 mL of water. Shake thoroughly.}
\item{Add about 2 mL of lime water in the test tube, insert the free end of the delivery tube into the test tube, making sure that it is immersed in the lime water. Cover the test tube with cotton wool.}
\item{Dip the bottle containing the mixture of yeast and sugar in a warm water bath, make sure that the opening of the delivery tube remains submerged in the lime water.}
\item{Check periodically for bubbles passing through the lime water and note any changes that occur in the limewater.}
\item{After a change in the lime water has been noted, smell the yeast solution.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
The lime water will turn milky showing the presence of carbon dioxide gas.
The students should detect a slight smell of alcohol from the mixture of glucose and yeast showing that there is production of alcohol during anaerobic respiration.

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Unused lime water should be stored in a well labelled reagent bottle for further use.}
\item{Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later. No special waste disposal is required.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Why is it important to boil the water used to make the yeast solution prior to this experiment?}
\item{Name the gas produced during this reaction.}
\item{Why was glucose added to the solution of yeast?}
\item{Why was the solution submerged in a warm water bath?}
\item{What smell do you detect from the mixture of glucose and yeast after the experiment?}
\item{Where is the principal of anaerobic respiration applied in a Tanzanian village? How are the products used?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
This principle is applied in the manufacture of local alcoholic beverages in the village.
If you find that the gas is taking a long time to form, you can gently squeeze the bottle containing the yeast solution. This will force any gas formed through the delivery tube and will speed up the change in lime water. If this is done, be sure not to release the bottle before removing the cap when the straw is still submerged in limewater-this will cause a sucking back action and the limewater will be sucked into the yeast solution.
The smell of alcohol my be faint and hard to detect, if this is the case leave the solution for 3-4 days and have  smell it again.
