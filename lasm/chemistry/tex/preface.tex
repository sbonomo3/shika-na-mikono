\chapter*{Preface}

As the era of Alternative to Practical comes to a end, it is my hope 
that science teachers nationally embrace the new paradigm, that the science lesson 
should be student-centered, competiency-based, activity-oriented, and connect 
with student's life experience. Every student in Tanzania should perform practical exercises, not just the few tested on national exams, but the wide range of hands-on activities teachers should employ to build a deep understanding in their students.

Educational research has identifed two obstactes to the universal 
implementation of hands-on science education. First, many teachers themselves learned 
in Alternative to Practical schools and therefore lack essential experience 
with hands-on science. Every effort is already underway to overcome 
this deficiency. A national in-service training program reaches tens of thousand of educators annually, and a Teachers' Guide has already been written to explain for teachers the standard execution of dozens of hands-on activities in [Subject].

The remaining challenge is a falacy rooted in ignorance and complacency: the idea that the materials required for hands-on science teaching are unavailable to most schools. We reject the notion that science cannot be learned without expensive imported materials. Everything required 
to teach modern science is already availalbe in our villages and towns. 

[Subject] belongs to Tanzania as much as any country in the world. [The 
law of gravity respects no national boundries; we all feel its effect 
and can measure its strength. // ] Those who decry the use of locally 
available materials as "stone age science" misunderstand the meaning 
of Science - that it applies universally, in any situation, with any materials. 
Dependance on expensive imported materials teaches students that Science is a foreign 
concept, to be memorized rather than understood, and that Science lacks 
application to daily life. Science is the birthright of humanity, 
as much as Language or Mathematics or Music, and the time has come to 
embrace what we already own.

This Companion Guide was written to equipt teachers with the knowledge and skills to deliver 
hands-on science lessons in any school, most especially those without standard science laboratories. I hope that this Companion Guide will also inspire school inspectors, examiners, curriculum developers and college tutors to increase their emphasis on the importance of hands-on teaching, and to reject material deficiencies as an excuse for any absence of practical work. In the same spirit, this Companion Guide seeks to expand the range of approaches to learning [Subject] and it is my hope that the many stakeholders in science education will embrace alternative methods that enable quality science education for every student.
